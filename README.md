# ü§ñ Pythora

**Pythora** is a decentralized agent built using the [Autonolas](https://olas.network/) framework to fetch real-time price feeds from the [Pyth Network](https://pyth.network/) off-chain and update them on-chain.
Pyth Network provides real-time financial market data to smart contracts, as well as allows to request secure, verifiable random numbers using Pyth Entropy. 
This project is designed for the "price pusher" use case.

## üß† What It Does

Pythora creates an **Olas Agent** that:
1. **Fetches price data** from Pyth‚Äôs off-chain Hermes API.
2. **Processes and verifies** the data to meet on-chain formatting requirements.
3. **Updates the data on-chain** using the `updatePriceFeeds` method.
4. **Automates the cycle**, ensuring decentralized and continuous price updates with no manual intervention.

## Development Tools

This project was initially scaffolded using [adev](https://github.com/8ball030/auto_dev), an awesome tool that helped me quickly generate the agent structure. It also allowed me to seamlessly convert a Mermaid diagram into a well-structured behavior flow ‚Äî saving a ton of time and effort!
